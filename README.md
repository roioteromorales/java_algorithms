# java_algorithms

This repository is for practicing algorithms and working with data structures in Java.

## Arrays

### Search.java
This includes integer array implementations of:
- **linear search**
- **binary search - recursive**
- **binary search - non recursive**

### Sort.java
This includes integer array implementations of:
- **bubble sort**
- **insertion sort**
- **selection sort**
- **merge sort**


You can test by running *ArrayTester.java*.

## Linked Lists

### SingleLinkedList.java
This is an implementation of generic single linked lists.


### DoubleLinkedList.java
This is an implementation of generic double linked lists.


You can test both types of lists by running *LinkedListTester.java*.
Methods include: add, insert, remove, get, set, size, toString

## Cryptography

### Caesar.java

This **Caesar Cipher** implementation can encrypt/decrypt a string by passing it to the *crypt method* with a key (negative key for decryption).

You can test by running *CryptoTest.java*.
