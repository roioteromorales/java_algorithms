This repository is for practicing algorithms and working with data structures in Java.

## Arrays

### Search.java
This includes integer array implementations of:
- **linear search**
- **binary search - recursive**
- **binary search - non recursive**

### Sort.java
This includes integer array implementations of:
- **bubble sort**
- **insertion sort**
- **selection sort**
- **merge sort**
- **quick sort**


You can test by running *ArrayTester.java*.

## Cryptography
